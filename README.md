Description:     Our Allee and Iris Patisserie is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Python's Tkinter library. 
             It serves as a management system for a pastry shop, allowing users to browse various pastry categories, add items to 
             their cart, and proceed to checkout.The application features an admin login for managing the shop and provides detailed
             information about the shop's offerings.The user experience is enhanced with a visually appealing design, including a pink
             background and organized layouts.
                 Our project is a user-friendly interface wherein this allows the user to successfully navigate the application.
             As part of this, we implement different product categories wherein users can browse through different categories of pastries,
             such as cakes, pastries, cupcakes, tarts and lastly bread.The admin login functionality is used in our system to manage the shop.
             We also created a shopping cart in there specially and in that case the users can add the products to their cart, extensively
             view their cart contents and as well as proceed to checkout.Our system will not be fully implemented if we do not create a
             functionality that manages fo receipt generation. On this function, upon the checkout, the PDF receipt is generated and as well 
             as displayed to the user.
                As part of our conclusion, Allee and Iris Patisserie is a comprehensive pastry ordering system that combines a user-friendly 
             interface with essential functionalities for browsing and purchasing pastries. The application effectively manages user interactions, 
             from viewing products to processing orders and generating receipts. The use of Tkinter for GUI development, along with the organization 
             of functions, ensures a smooth user experience while maintaining the application's functionality. This pastry shop management system can
             serve as a template for similar applications in the food and beverage industry, highlighting the importance of a well-designed user 
             interface and efficient backend processes.
